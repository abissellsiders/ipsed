<div align="left">See the Appendixes to the essay in this chapter for a general discussion of the tables and the sources of the data, along with a key to abbreviations used in this chapter and general information on matters such as regional definitions, calendar differences, money, and weights and measures.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">The general state of the economy of the Continental Colonies and the early United States has concerned both contemporaries and later writers.  These data repeat and attempt to reconcile several twentieth-century estimates of either the gross domestic product (GDP) at some point during the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries or the rate of growth of GDP between two or more points over the period.  GDP measures the total output of goods and services in the economy, valued at market prices.  As presented here, these data offer estimates of GDP in current dollars and in constant or real (1840) dollars.  They differ only slightly from the numbers given in the source reflecting the revised population estimates presented herein (Table Eg1&ndash;59).  Although these series provide only the crudest of estimates, they do support the proposition that the economy grew intensively over a century and a half, albeit very slowly by modern standards.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">For the sake of continuity in comparisons with GDP estimates for later periods, the data in this table include black Americans as part of the producing population even though the fruits of their labor, as enslaved people, were expropriated by their owners.  Compare Thomas [J.] Weiss, &ldquo;U.S. Labor Force Estimates and Economic Growth, 1800&ndash;1860,&rdquo; in Robert E. Gallman and John Joseph Wallis, editors, <i>American Economic Growth and Standards of Living before the Civil War</i>, National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Report (University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 19&ndash;75.  Had GDP (series Eg219) been measured against only the free population, the annual average rate in increase of GDP, 1650&ndash;1774, would be reported at 0.8 percent.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">Another discussion of early American GDP can be found in John J. McCusker and Russell R. Menard, <i>The Economy of British America, 1607&ndash;1789</i>, 2nd edition (University of North Carolina Press, 1991), pp. 51&ndash;70.  See also David W. Galenson, &ldquo;The Settlement and Growth of the Colonies: Population, Labor, and Economic Development,&rdquo; in Stanley L. Engerman and Robert E. Gallman, editors, <i>The Cambridge Economic History of the United States</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1996), volume 1, pp. 189&ndash;207.  More recently, the topic was the focus of a special issue of the <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i>, 3rd series, 56 (January 1999).  See especially the introductory essay by the two editors of the issue, Lance Davis and Stanley Engerman, &ldquo;The Economy of British North America: Miles Traveled, Miles Still to Go&rdquo; (pp. 9&ndash;22).</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">Angus Maddison, <i>The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective</i> (Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2001), p. 264, presented estimates of real, per capita GDP for the United States in 1600, 1700, and 1820 that support the figures in this table.  According to his data, the annual average compound rate of growth for the seventeenth century was 0.28 percent and for the extended eighteenth century, 0.73 percent.  One can argue that 1650 would be a better date than 1600 for the first estimate; then the rate for the seventeenth century is 0.55 percent.  Over the years 1650&ndash;1829, the rate is 0.68 percent.  Note, too, that for the whole period 1500&ndash;1820 (p. 265), the rate of growth for the United States is the highest in the world.</div>

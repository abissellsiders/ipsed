#' @description The National Fraternal Congress was founded in 1886 to organize and provide benefits for fraternal benefit societies (nearly all mutual aid insurance systems, mostly burial, life, and sickness insurance). It also published a yearly statistical overview of fraternal insurance's finances for their member organizations, "Statistics, Fraternal Societies", from 1894 onwards.
